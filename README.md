This repository is created for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) revision. It contains a collection of pattern-based DSA problems that help strengthen problem-solving skills and build a clear understanding of common algorithmic approaches. Each problem is solved with a focus on logic, efficiency, and clarity, making it useful for interview preparation, quick revision, and concept reinforcement. This repository is intended for anyone who wants to revisit core DSA patterns and improve their consistency in solving algorithmic problems.
